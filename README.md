To filter out porn we have collected a lot of dirty words during the years. We maintain two sets of list. One containing single words, the other two words phrases.

The phrases normally yield the most correct results. For example can a document contain both “girls” and “nude” without necessarily be pornographic. But if the phrases “nude girls” is found, the chance for it to be porn increases dramatically.
